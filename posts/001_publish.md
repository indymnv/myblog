# Why have I decided to open a blog?

During my journey in the IT world, I have discovered a world that still fascinates me quite a lot. I finished my master's in industrial engineering. Then I got a job as a business analyst, I didn't enjoy so much, and almost returned to academia to get a Ph.D. I landed a job as a Business Intelligence Engineer for a food production company, and my immersion in technology began. 

The covid 19 pandemic arrived and locked me up for almost a year in my department. Every day the only thing I did was get up at 5 in the morning to do a little exercise, have a coffee and see what there was in the world of data science I could learn. I finished my work day and continued investigating things. What if I use this new language? How about this framework? A course on deep learning? And so, for several months, driven by my curiosity. Then I quit my job and came to Japan.

While living in Tokyo and studying Japanese, I continue my path in the world of data, trying to understand the world better and work for hand in hand with technology. That is why this blog aims to take different ideas and projects that I am working on or new content that I continue to learn.
